    "1. What is the role of the 'else' block in a try-except statement? Provide an example scenario where it would be useful.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "     a) The purpose of the else block in try-except is to execute code that should only run if no exceptions were raised in the try block.\n",
    "    b)The else block is optional, and it follows all the except blocks in a try-except statement.\n",
    "    c)If no exceptions are raised in the try block, the code in the else block is executed. This is useful for cases where you want to perform some action only if the try block completes successfully.\n",

    "\n",
    "Logging:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging is a means of tracking events that happen when some software runs. Logging is important for software developing, debugging, and running. If you don’t have any logging record and your program crashes, there are very few chances that you detect the cause of the problem. And if you detect the cause, it will consume a lot of time. With logging, you can leave a trail of breadcrumbs so that if something goes wrong, we can determine the cause of the problem.\n",
    "Levels of Log Message:\n",
    "\n",
    "Debug (Level-10): These are used to give Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n",
    "Info (Level-20) : These are used to confirm that things are working as expected.\n",
    "Warning (Level-30) : These are used an indication that something unexpected happened, or is indicative of some problem in the near future.\n",
    "Error (Level-40) : This tells that due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.\n",
    "Critical (Level-50) : This tells serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "a)Logging is essential to understand the behaviour of the application and to debug unexpected issues or for simply tracking events. In the production environment, we can’t debug issues without proper log files as they become the only source of information to debug some intermittent or unexpected errors.\n",
    "b)Helps Troubleshooting Bugs.\n",
    "c)Improves Monitoring Projects in Production Environments.\n",
    "d)Facilitates Debugging.\n",
    "e)You can easily control the format of the messages you log. The module comes with a lot of useful attributes that you can decide to include in your log.\n",
    "f)You can log messages with different levels of urgency/warning/information. This allows you to categorize log messages easily and makes your debugging life way easier.\n",
    "g)You can set the destination of your logs to pretty much anything. Even to sockets.\n",
